                        <p>A growing web developer located in Chicago, IL. I'm super duper ecstatic about making bomb-ass websites with various coding tools such as HTML/CSS and Javascript! I have a penchant for designing aesthetically pleasing websites with clean and unambiguous code. I prefer to be thorough with my work but also detailed with not only the visual elements but also user interaction.</p>
                        <p>I also have a passion for creating stories in my free time and hope to implement my love for it into how I make websites. When I code and design websites, I want to make it a story experience so that it has a lasting impression on anyone who visits.</p>
                        <p>I hope to implement various parts of my life, including hobbies, inspirations, and influences, to be a part of what I create for when it comes to web development. Coding is just as important and a vital part of my life as the things I love to do.</p>
                        <p>I'm a foodie who loves exploring new places by getting a taste of the food in the area. I also love immersing myself in stories and consider myself a films &amp; tv shows trash, and I also greatly enjoy reading books &amp; graphic novels, and playing video games.</p>
